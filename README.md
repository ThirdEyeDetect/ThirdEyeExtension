# ThirdEye browser extension

ThirdEye is a continuous authentication system for Facebook on the Google Chrome web browser. It scrapes a user's Facebook activity directly of the browser to create a profile. Subsequent user Facebook activity is run in context of the generated profile. If observed activity deviates significantly expected behavior, the user is notified through a pre-established secondary communication method such as email.
